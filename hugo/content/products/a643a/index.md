 This collection is an absolute feast for puzzle fans. For nearly a decade, Draknek &amp; Friends have been crafting bespoke, lovingly designed puzzle experiences that take a theme, mechanic, or ludicrous idea and push it to its natural conclusion. This collection features four of these award-winning experiences, packaged together on a single Nintendo Switch cartridge for over 100 hours of head-scratching goodness. 

The crown jewel of this collection is A Monster’s Expedition, an open-world puzzle adventure that casts players as a monster exploring an archipelago museum of human culture. The game’s central log-rolling mechanic unfolds &amp; unfurls into escalating complexities that have you constantly reconsidering the space around you both laterally and logically. That space, too, is presented in such a fun and welcoming aesthetic that frustration is consistently held at bay — learning becomes a genuine pleasure, as it should be. 

And that’s just ONE of the FOUR brilliant puzzle games you get here! We could go on and on about the charm of A Good Snowman is Hard to Build, the sublime pleasures of spending hours in Sokobond, or the seemingly endless satisfaction that comes from planning routes in Cosmic Express, but we’ll let you discover the magic on your own.
