 Introducing Demon Throttle by developer Doinksoft, the creators of Gato Roboto. Coming to Nintendo Switch as a physical box - and only a physical box set. DEMON THROTTLE is a true collector's edition... of an amazing NEW game. This game premieres in 2022, when you get it in the mail. It will not be available digitally.

Demon Throttle tells the story of a beautiful vampiress and dusty gunslinger on a quest for vengeance against a demon that stole her mystical chalices and slept with his estranged wife. Now the two unlikely companions must blast their way through four monstrous generals and their wicked domains to lift the demon's curse and exact their revenge.
