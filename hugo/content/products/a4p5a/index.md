 For the first time in a railway simulator, you are the driver and the company manager!

TAKE THE CONTROL OF YOUR TRAIN AND TRAVEL TO EUROPE
Drive your passengers or goods across 10 countries and explore the countryside, towns, forests, and mountains of Europe from your cab. Each locomotive has its own characteristics (power, braking, etc.), and you need to learn to control it expertly while following the railway signs and adapting to the weather conditions.

BECOME A TRUE RAILWAY ENTREPRENEUR
As well as driving trains, you need to operate a successful company. Create your own company; buy and maintain your trains; hire conductors and give them new contracts; explore new routes, and optimize your Passenger and Freight activities. Make the right choices to earn money and grow your business!
