Limited Run # 102
 Includes three classic DOOM games preserved on one cartridge - DOOM, DOOM II, and DOOM 3! No game downloads required. These classic games popularized the first-person shooter and allow players to wield an arsenal of powerful weapons as you battle demon hordes on Mars, on Earth, and across Hell. DOOM: You’re one of Earth’s toughest marines stationed on mars when a military experiment opens the gates to hell. It’s up to you to beat back the demon hordes with an arsenal of brutal weapons in DOOM, the game that pioneered the first-person shooter genre and changed video games forever. DOOM II: The beloved sequel to the groundbreaking DOOM (1993), DOOM II sends you to Earth, gives players the brutal Super Shotgun to bear against deadlier demons, and makes you face an iconic boss, the Icon of Sin. DOOM 3: In this critically acclaimed action-horror re-telling of the original DOOM, players battle their way through a dimly-lit and terrifying, demon-infested UAC facility on Mars before entering the abyss to battle Hell's mightiest warrior.
