 Welcome to Willowdale, your life of farming and adventure starts here!

The once-thriving town of Willowdale is in ruins! The mayor’s business-minded daughter Penny has seized the opportunity to transport this once pleasant place into a high-flying modern tourist destination. She doesn’t really like animals and thinks keeping livestock is dirty especially when you can import all these products easily from a nearby town. With humans and nature so out of balance… some animals felt abandoned and had already left. Is it too late to stop the changes set in motion by her?

Your uncle, mayor Moneybags calls for your help. Return to your family’s farm to help restore harmony between the people and nature! It is time to light the way for the lost people of the town by reigniting their passion and helping them appreciate the beauty of Willowdale!
