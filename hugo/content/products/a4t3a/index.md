 Hello Neighbor 2 is the sequel to the popular stealth horror game about sneaking into your creepy neighbor's house. You play as a local journalist investigating missing person reports when you follow a series of clues leading you back to the abandoned house of The Neighbor.

The only problem is, that it's occupied by a mysterious crow-like being. The only logical thing to do is break in. Welcome back to Raven Brooks.
