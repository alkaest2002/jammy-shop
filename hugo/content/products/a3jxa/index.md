LIMITED RUN #109

Blaster Master Zero 3's hybrid of sidescrolling and top-down action is back for its 3rd chapter, and more intense than ever before! Series protagonist Jason travels to where the series all began, the planet Sophia, in order to save series heroine Eve in this final installment of the BMZ trilogy.

In the previous game, Blaster Master Zero 2, Jason and his partner Eve finally reach their destination, the planet Sophia, after a long and arduous journey through space. However, a new threat was already lying in wait for them upon their arrival.
Without warning, they were attacked, captured, and separated from each other by Sophia's military, the Sophia Force.
Jason's new journey begins on Sophia after he escapes from the Sophia Force base aboard his All-Terrain Battle Tank, G-SOPHIA SV, and begins his search for Eve.
