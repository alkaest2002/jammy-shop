 Come for the view, stay for the friends.

Welcome to Cozy Grove, a life-sim game about camping on a haunted, ever-changing island. As a Spirit Scout, you'll wander the island's forest each day, finding new hidden secrets and helping soothe the local ghosts. With a little time and a lot of crafting, you'll bring color and joy back to Cozy Grove!

Cozy Grove is synced to real-world time and provides 30-60 minutes of new quest content each day. After that, you can fish, craft, and decorate to your heart's content!
